</p>

The [Wingman-AI](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WingMan.wing-man) extension brings high quality AI assisted coding right to your computer, it's 100% free and data never leaves your machine - meaning it's completely private! Since the current release of this extension relies on running the AI models locally using [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/), it is recommended you are on a machine with capable graphics card (Apple M series/Nvidia cards) for the best performance.

## 🚀 Getting Started

We recommend starting with Ollama with a deepseek model(s), [see why here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mike-ravkine/can-ai-code-results).

-   Install this extension from the VS Code Marketplace: [Wingman-AI](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WingMan.wing-man)
-   Install [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/)
-   Install the supported local models by running the following command(s):
    **Example**:
    -   _ollama pull deepseek-coder:6.7b-base-q4_1_
    -   _ollama pull deepseek-coder:6.7b-instruct-q8_0_
-   That's it! This extension will validate that the models are configured correctly in it's VSCode settings upon launch. If you wish to customize which models run see the [FAQ section](#faq).

## Features

### Code Completion

The AI will look for natural pauses in typing to decide when to offer code suggestions (keep in mind the AI is limited by your machine speed).

### Interactive Chat

Talk to the AI naturally! It will use open files as context to answer your question, or simply select a section of code to use as context.

## AI Providers

### Ollama

[Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) is a free and open-source AI model provider, allowing users to run their own local models.

#### Why Ollama?

[Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) was chosen for it's simplicity, allowing users to pull a number of models in different configurations and update them at will. Ollama will pull optimized models based on your system architecture, however if you do not have a GPU accelerated machine, models will be slower.

#### Setting up Ollama

Follow the directions on the [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) website. Ollama has a number of open source models available that are capable of writing high quality code. See [getting started](#🚀-getting-started) for how to pull and customize models.

#### Supported Models

The extension uses a separate model for chat and code completion. This is due to the fact that different types of models have different strengths, mixing and matching offers the best result.

Supported Models for _Code Completion_:

-   Deepseek-base _(tested with: [deepseek-coder:6.7b-base-q4_1](https://ollama.ai/library/deepseek-coder:6.7b-base-q4_1))_
-   Codellama-code _(tested with: [codellama:7b-code-q4_K_M](https://ollama.ai/library/codellama:7b-code-q4_K_M))_

Supported Models for _Chat_:

-   Deepseek-Instruct _(tested with: [deepseek-coder:6.7b-instruct-q8_0](https://ollama.ai/library/deepseek-coder:6.7b-instruct-q8_0))_
-   Codellama-Instruct _(tested with: [codellama:7b-instruct](https://ollama.ai/library/codellama:7b-instruct))_
-   Phind-CodeLlama - _(tested with: [phind-codellama:34b-v2-q2_K](https://ollama.ai/library/phind-codellama:34b-v2-q2_K))_

### Hugging Face

[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) supports hosting and training models, but also supports running many models _(under 10GB)_ for free! All you have to do is [create a free account](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/quicktour). **_This does mean that data leaves your machine!_** But this is an excellent option if you don't have the compute locally to run Ollama.

#### Setting up Hugging Face

Once you have a Hugging Face account and an API key, all you need to do is open the VSCode settings pane for this extension "Wingman" (see [FAQ](#faq)).

Once it's open, select "HuggingFace" as the AI Provider and add your API key under the HuggingFace section:

#### Supported Models

The extension uses a separate model for chat and code completion. This is due to the fact that different types of models have different strengths, mixing and matching offers the best result.

Supported Models for _Code Completion_:

-   CodeLlama _(tested with: [codellama/CodeLlama-7b-hf](https://huggingface.co/codellama/CodeLlama-7b-hf))_

Supported Models for _Chat_:

-   Mistral v0.2 _(tested with: [mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2))_

## FAQ

-   _How can I change which models are being used?_ This extension uses settings like any other VSCode extension, see the examples below. **NOTE Changing a model reloads reloading VSCode (on mac cmd+R).**

-   _The AI models feel slow, why?_ As of _pre-release 0.0.6_ we've added an indicator in the bottom status bar to show you when an AI model is actively processing. If you aren't using GPU accelerated hardware, you may need to look into [Quantization](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/concept_guides/quantization)].

## Troubleshooting

This extension leverages Ollama due to it's simplicity and ability to deliver the right container optimized for your running environment.
However good AI performance relies on your machine specs, so if you do not have the ability to GPU accelerate, responses may be slow.
During startup the extension will verify the models you have configured in the VSCode settings pane for this extension, the extension does have some defaults:

**Code Model** - deepseek-coder:6.7b-base-q4_1

**Chat Model** - deepseek-coder:6.7b-instruct-q8_0

The models above will require enough RAM to run them correctly, you should have at least 12GB of ram on your machine if you are running these models. If you don't have enough ram, then choose a smaller model but be aware that it won't perform as well. Also see [information on model Quantization](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/concept_guides/quantization).
